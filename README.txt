**** Heuristic Optimization assignment.

*** To compile/clean:
make
make clean



*** To run on one instance:
./lop -i instances/instance_name algo neighborhood initial_solution_method
example : ./lop -i instances/N-be75eec_150 first exchange cw


*** Best known solutions:
The best known solutions are in best_known/best_known.txt

*** The solutions for each combination are in files:
lop_algo_neighborhood_initialsolmethod.dat 
the times for each instance are in files:
lop_algo_neighborhood_initialsolmethod_times.dat 
example:
lop_best_insertion_random.dat
lop_best_insertion_random_times.dat
